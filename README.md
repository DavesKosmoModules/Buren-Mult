![Buren Photo](/Docs/Buren-Mult-Photo.png)

An active mult in Kosmo modular synth format

- 3 input 9 output active mult
- Normalized inputs can be 1 in 9 out, 3 in 3 outs or 2 in 3 out + 6 out
- Original concept was to allow patching of V/oct, Gate & velocity from a sequencer

Contained are schematics & gerber files for pcb fabrication of both electrical and front panel. This is sutiable for entry level however a basic level of electronics, soldering, fault finding, and some basic tools are required.

If you wish to edit in ki-cad the following dependencies are required
